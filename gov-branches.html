        <h3>
            Understanding the three branches of government is essential for
            anyone interested in American politics and governance. This page
            provides you with comprehensive information about the executive,
            legislative, and judicial branches of the United States government.
        </h3>

        <h1 class="exec-title">Executive Branch</h1>

        <h2 class="exec-branch">
            The executive branch is responsible for enforcing and administering
            the laws of the United States. At its head is the President of the
            United States, who serves as both the head of state and the head of
            government. The President is aided by various executive departments,
            agencies, and offices, each tasked with specific functions such as
            national security, foreign affairs, and domestic policy. Explore the
            powers and responsibilities of the executive branch, including the
            President's role as commander-in-chief, chief diplomat, and chief
            executive.

        <h1 class="leg-title">Legislative Branch</h1>

        <h2 class="leg-branch">
            The legislative branch, also known as Congress, is responsible for
            making the laws of the United States. It consists of two chambers:
            the House of Representatives and the Senate. Members of Congress are
            elected by the American people to represent their interests and
            concerns at the federal level. Discover how laws are proposed,
            debated, and enacted through the legislative process. Learn about
            the powers of Congress, including the authority to levy taxes,
            declare war, and regulate interstate commerce.

        <h1 class="jud-title">Judicial Branch</h1>

        <h2 class="jud-branch">
            The judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the laws of the
            United States and resolving disputes according to the Constitution
            and established legal principles. At its apex is the Supreme Court,
            the highest court in the land. The Supreme Court, along with lower
            federal courts, hears cases involving constitutional issues, federal
            laws, and disputes between states. Delve into the structure of the
            federal court system and the role of judges in upholding the rule of
            law and protecting individual rights.
